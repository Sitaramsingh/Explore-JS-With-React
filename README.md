# Explore-JS-With-React

A hands-on repository to learn and demonstrate modern JavaScript concepts using React. This repo contains notes, examples, small exercises and portfolio-style projects that progressively cover JS fundamentals through real React applications.

## Goals
- Learn JavaScript core and modern patterns (ES6+)
- Apply JS concepts in React projects
- Build, test and deploy practical apps to show on a portfolio
- Keep experiments small, focused, and reproducible

## Repo structure (suggested)
- /notes                — short topic notes & examples
- /examples             — small focused examples (one concept per app)
- /projects             — portfolio-style projects (todo, blog, e‑commerce)
- /tests                — unit/integration test examples
- /configs              — shared tooling (eslint, prettier, vite configs)

## Topics to explore
- JavaScript: scope, closures, promises/async, modules, array methods, immutability
- DOM basics (where applicable)
- React: components, props, hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef, useMemo, useCallback)
- Routing (react-router), forms and validation
- State management: Context API, Redux or Zustand
- TypeScript with React
- Testing: Jest + React Testing Library
- Performance and optimization
- Build & deploy: Vite, Netlify, Vercel, Docker
- Accessibility, linting, and CI

## Quick start
1. Install Node.js (LTS)
2. Clone the repo:
   git clone <repo-url>
3. Create an example or open an existing one, then:
   npm install
   npm run dev

(Each example/project will include its own README with run instructions.)

## Contribution
- Add focused examples or short notes
- Keep PRs small and descriptive
- Add tests for examples where relevant

## Roadmap / Milestones
1. JS fundamentals + 1 small React demo
2. Hooks deep-dive + intermediate project
3. TypeScript + testing + deployable full-stack demo

## Resources
- Official React docs: https://reactjs.org
- MDN Web Docs for JavaScript
